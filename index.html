          <h2 class="about-title">About Prateek Suri</h2>

          <p>
            Prateek Suri is not just an entrepreneur—practically a myth-teller
            of innovation, a legacy builder, and the author of Gateway to
            Africa, a memoir depicting a journey few dare challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Born in Delhi, India, Prateek's interest in ideas that change lives
            started early. A Modern School, Barakhamba Road, student, and
            subsequently a Mechanical Engineering graduate from BITS Pilani, he
            brought with him a natural affinity for technology and
            problem-solving. Something that started as curiosity turned into
            conviction—the conviction that unconventional ideas, pursued with
            determination, can alter the fate of entire markets.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was that belief that found expression in Maser Group, the
            business he created and grew into a $5 billion market-cap giant.
            With a single focus on democratising tech through affordability and
            accessibility, he set his sights on Africa—a continent rich in
            promise but underpenetrated by multinational tech giants. Maser not
            only retailed more than 800,000 smart TVs but also became a digital
            divide bridge, empowering families, providing employment, and
            redefining Africa's tech story. With a successful exit, Prateek
            initiated MDR Investments with a $500 million fund, venturing into
            infrastructure, mining, AI, and property—consolidating his position
            as an economic change catalyst.
          </p>

          <p>
            But outside the boardroom and the balance sheets is another Prateek:
            the horseman who hears rhythm and sense in the canter of a horse,
            the investor who backs courageous start-ups, and the family man who
            thinks success is not to be measured in terms of dollars, but in
            terms of lives transformed and strengthened. His philanthropic
            work—working for African sport, education, and community
            development—resonates with his conviction that prosperity is not
            singular.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prateek's is a tale of courage and persistence, of dream becoming
            empire, and empire becoming influence. Gateway to Africa is both his
            personal record and his welcome—to believers, dreamers, and doers
            everywhere—to pursue the exceptional.
          </p>

          <p>
            His upcoming book, Gateway to Africa, is more than just a memoir—it
            serves as a guide for anyone brave enough to pursue opportunities in
            uncharted territories. Through candid reflections and impactful
            insights, Prateek shares the lessons, setbacks, and victories that
            have shaped his evolution from a young dreamer in Delhi to one of
            Africa’s most influential business figures.

            About the Book — <em>Gateway to Africa</em>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <em>Gateway to Africa</em> isn’t just a memoir; it’s like getting a
            front-row seat to the birth of a billion-dollar dream. In this
            deeply personal and insightful narrative, Prateek Suri takes us on a
            journey from the bustling streets of Delhi to the high-stakes
            boardrooms of Africa, revealing how resilience, risk-taking, and
            unwavering belief can create empires where it once seemed
            impossible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The story kicks off with the poignant loss of his ancestral home in
            Greater Kailash, a pivotal moment that fueled his determination to
            reclaim it one day. From his early days at BITS Pilani Dubai to the
            defining choice to never work for anyone else, Prateek lays the
            groundwork for a journey driven by ambition and a clear sense of
            purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Maser unfolds in these pages, we see how a small electronics
            trading company transformed into a $5 billion African unicorn,
            shaking up industries and making technology accessible to all. Each
            chapter peels back a new layer of the continent—West Africa’s blend
            of chaos and opportunity, East Africa’s rich cultural tapestry, the
            untapped mining potential, and the tech revolution that Covid-19
            accelerated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interspersed throughout are vivid anecdotes that breathe life into
            Africa: the notorious traffic jams of Lagos, the vibrant Igbo naming
            ceremonies, evenings spent at Fela Kuti’s shrine, and the lively
            Swahili chatter in Nairobi’s markets. These aren’t just business
            lessons; they’re experiences that shaped Prateek’s worldview—you
            don’t just enter Africa; you’re welcomed in.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Gateway to Africa</em> also casts an eye toward the future,
            sharing Prateek’s vision for MDR Investments, the burgeoning startup
            scene in Africa, and the importance of sustainable mining and
            infrastructure in determining the continent’s future. It’s as much
            about valuing companies as it is about upholding values, about
            building not just wealth but also communities and sovereignty.
          </p>

          <p>
            With honesty and passion, Prateek Suri encourages us to view Africa
            not as the “market of tomorrow” but as the vibrant heart of today’s
            global economy. His journey is a testament to the magic that happens
            when courage meets opportunity.
